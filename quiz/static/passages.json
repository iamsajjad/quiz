    "passage": "The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century in Britain, marked a significant shift from agrarian economies to industrialized societies. This era saw the rise of factories, powered by innovations such as the steam engine and advancements in textile manufacturing. Urbanization surged as people moved from rural areas to cities in search of work, leading to the growth of industrial hubs. However, this period was not without its challenges. Harsh working conditions, child labor, and environmental degradation became widespread issues. On the brighter side, the Industrial Revolution catalyzed economic growth, technological innovation, and improvements in transportation, such as the development of railroads. This transformative era not only reshaped economies but also laid the foundation for modern industrial practices.",

This cycle consists of several stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers evaporates due to the Sun's heat, turning into water vapor. This vapor cools and condenses to form clouds, which eventually lead to precipitation in the form of rain, snow, or hail. Some of this water infiltrates the ground, replenishing aquifers, while the rest flows back into water bodies as runoff. The water cycle is crucial for maintaining life and ecosystems on Earth.",

    "passage": "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. It is composed of two strands forming a double helix, with each strand made of nucleotides containing a sugar, phosphate, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine). DNA determines the traits of an organism and is passed from parents to offspring. The discovery of its structure by Watson and Crick in 1953 was a groundbreaking moment in biology.",
